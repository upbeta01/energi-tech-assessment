# Question 5

**Script grown-ups:** Solve the problem in question 4 using any programming language of your choice.


# Answer

I like Python, but not like how I like my dogs.

```
$ python3 --version
Python 3.11.9

$ python3
----

sentence = "I have 3 dogs, namely; one, two, three"

# Replace "one" with "uno"
sentence = sentence.replace("one", "uno")

# Replace "two" with "dos"
sentence = sentence.replace("two", "dos")

# Replace "three" with "tres"
sentence = sentence.replace("three", "tres")

print(sentence)
```
