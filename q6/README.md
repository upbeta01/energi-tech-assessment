# Question 6

**Terraform lovers:** write a Terraform module that creates the following resources in IAM:

- A role,with no permissions, which can be assumed by users within the same
 account
- A policy, allowing users / entities to assume the above role
- A group,with the above policy attached
- A user,belonging to the above group
- All four entities should have the same name, or be similarly named in some meaningful way given the context e.g. prod-ci-role, prod-ci-policy prod-ci-group, prod-ci-user; or just prod-ci. Make the suffixes toggleable, if you wish.
